# Gophercraft Code of Conduct

We like to keep things relaxed and friendly.

These are not edicts but suggestions (which should be obvious to decent people).

You should do your best, however, to follow them in order to avoid becoming excluded from the project.

### Do's

- Be patient and respectful.

Nobody likes an asshole. People are more likely to listen to what you have to say if you say it respectfully, and with constructive goals in mind.

- Cultivate an atmosphere of inclusivity.

We get it, you're a 10x l33t hacker. Be friendly to newcomers and people who are educating themselves. Don't mock people for simply asking questions.

- Follow the laws of your jurisdiction.

Adhere to the GNU General Public License. Don't break the law, and don't encourage or pressure others into breaking the law on your behalf.

### Dont's

- Don’t be destructive or inflammatory. 

When criticizing others and/or their work, do so with the intention of building them up, not tearing them down.

This includes not bashing of other server cores/project. MaNGOS-based cores like CMaNGOS and TrinityCore have been indispensible to the Gophercraft project. Don't poo-poo projects which are the basis for the projects's success. 

- Don't harass people.

This can include:

  - Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.

  - Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.

  - Unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
