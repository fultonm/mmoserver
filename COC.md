# Gophercraft Code of Conduct

We like to keep things relaxed and friendly. Here are some tips to keep it that way:

- Be patient and respectful.

Nobody likes an asshole. People are more likely to listen to what you have to say if you say it respectfully, and with constructive goals in mind.

- Cultivate an atmosphere of inclusivity.

We get it, you're a 10x l33t hacker. Be friendly to newcomers and people who are educating themselves. Don't mock people for simply asking questions.

- Follow the laws of your jurisdiction.

Adhere to the GNU General Public License. Don't break the law, and don't encourage or pressure others into breaking the law on your behalf.

- Don’t be destructive or inflammatory. 

When criticizing others and/or their work, do so with the intention of building them up, not tearing them down.

- Don't harass people.

This can include:

  - Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.

  - Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.

  - Unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
